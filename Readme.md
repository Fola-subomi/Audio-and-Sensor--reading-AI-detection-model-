Okay, so I decided to do a project that would take me away from the learning curve and into the real world to equip me with the knowledge and skills I would need. 

So, an Audio and sensor reading AI system that probably detects if a faulting of surveillance of some sort is due to a fluctuation of the sensors, an external disturbance or as a result of a recording factor. 

Of course, right of the bat, the problem I concluded it was solving was the disposing of maybe relevant readings and or alerting a disturbance and I was just informed it basically takes readings and filters them.
The project is originally suposed to take readings in real time after training, but we will be using simulated readings.

These are the specs
Audio dataset - UrbanSound8K - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisfilo/urbansound8k  
Sensor dataset - Intel Lab Data - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/caesarlupum/iot-sensordata  
Combining the two is for an efficient model.   

Audio Model performance was evaluated with: Precision–Recall AUC
