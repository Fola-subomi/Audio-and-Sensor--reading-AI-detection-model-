Okay, so I decided to do a project that would take me away from the learning curve and into the real world to equip me with the knowledge and skills I would need. So because Chatgpt is my bestie, I decided to build one by asking it to suggest one based on what it knows about me. 

So, it suggested an Audio and sensor reading AI system that probably detects if a faulting of surveillance of some sort is due to a fluctuation of the sensors, an external disturbance or as a result of a recording factor. 
Of course, right of the bat, the problem I concluded it was solving was the disposing of maybe relevant readings and or alerting a disturbance and I was just informed it basically takes readings and filters them.
